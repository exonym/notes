# Sorry the generative-commons.org is unavailable in your region.

The commons is about how systems and people can cooperate: how to build cooperation, scale it, and how it fails. 

In Germany you can’t just publish a website without doxing yourself.  I know my personal details can be found easily, but that's only because the government makes sure of it … The point here is: in a country that is supposedly obsessed with privacy, publishing your home address is the price of publishing a website for public consumption.  I think that's 💩 , so I put a block up.
